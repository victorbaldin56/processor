# assembler
Compiler for simplified assembler-like language. Translates the following
commands to the bytecode compatible with my [VM_CPU](https://github.com/victorbaldin56/VM_CPU).

## Usage
### Build
1. `git clone https://github.com/victorbaldin56/assembler`
2. `make`

| 1            | out          | Pop a last value from stack and print it |
| 2            | push         | Push an argument following to the command code to stack |
| 3            | add          | Pop 2 last values from stack and push the sum to stack |
| 4            | sub          | Substract 2 last numbers from stack |
